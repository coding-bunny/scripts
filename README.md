# Scripts

This repository contains scripts that I, or my wife, uses for small tasks at work.
These scripts are free to be used by anyone else, but are simply provided "as is".
I will not take any responsibility for damages or misuse that come from these scripts.

If you do end up using these scripts, and want to open an issue,
please be aware that this is done in my free time, and written for specific use-cases.
